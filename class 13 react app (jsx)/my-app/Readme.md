# today we studied about virtual dom 
# And worked with react-router-dom which actually creates virtual dom in react 
# first we installed react router dom 
# then imported Link BrowserRouter Routes Route in differet files according to the needs of project
# We wrapped our app in browser router 
# and different components  to be rendered on respective  paths were wrapped in Routes and Route repectively
